    ways:
</p>
<ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        Legal obligations: We may be required to use and retain Personal Data for legal and compliance reasons, such as

        including to do the following things: (a) automatically update the applications on your system; (b) remember

        Services; (c) provide customized third-party advertisements, content and information, unless it will include
        instructions on how to opt out of receiving these advertisements, content and information in the future; (d)

    </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not share personal information with other third parties, except for legal reasons upon request by public
    authorities. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
</p>
<p><strong>Data Processing</strong></p>
<p>
    Our Services may collect non-personal data using integrated third-party services like Google Play services. Such
    data are stored in these third-party services. We do not store personal data on our servers. These services have
    their own privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
    We hereby undertake not to conduct any disclosure or transfer of the User’s personal data to any third parties,
    except Processors, mentioned in this paragraph, without receipt of personal consent of the User.
</p>
<p>
    You should know that we don’t process payments directly. Payments are processed via the Apple App Store
    <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store/" target="_blank">App Store Policy</a>. We don’t collect or store
    payment data, details or payments-related personal
    data. Payment processing takes place through a payment system, integrated into the app store.
</p>
<p><strong>How Long We Keep Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
    We will keep your Personal Information for the length of time required to provide you with the Service and for the
    reasons described in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
    Afterwards, we delete all aforementioned data in our possession within a reasonable timeframe. We do not verify the
    correctness of personal data that we collect or you provide. In all cases, we do not retain such data for more than
    12 months. If you no longer want us to use your information that we physically access and store, you can request
    that we erase your personal information.
</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data Protection</strong></p>
<p>
    The security of your information is fundamental to us. We have implemented industry standard security measures,
    which include the encryption to protect your personal information, including all information you input into your
    habit data or share in Services, and this information is not available to third parties.
</p>
<p><strong>User’s Rights</strong></p>
<p>
    The User is also entitled to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        request the access to and rectification or erasure of personal data;
    </li>
    <li>
        restrict the processing of personal data concerning the User;
    </li>
    <li>
        object to processing of personal data concerning the User;
    </li>
    <li>
        demand for realization of the right to data portability;
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        update Personal Data provided to us;
    </li>
    <li>
        the User is empowered to request one copy of the personal data undergoing processing free of charge. Any
        additional copies are provided on a reimbursement basis.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Policy Towards Children</strong></p>
<p>
    Our Services usually have a minimum age requirement of users and are not directed to children, and we do not
    knowingly collect Personal Data relating to children. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone
    number, or any personal information, without their parents’ prior permission.

    We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 18, unless more stringent regulation applies in their
    country of residence. In EU countries, users under the age of 16 are considered children, unless the data protection
    regulation of their country of residence specifies another age.

    If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal information without your consent, please contact
    us and we will take the required steps to delete such information.
</p>
