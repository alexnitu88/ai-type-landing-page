Whether you're crafting an email, responding to a text, or updating your social media, AIType offers unparalleled support.

## AIType vs. Grammarly: A Comparison

While Grammarly has been a household name with its grammarly check english and grammarly plagiarism checker free features, AIType takes it a step further. Here's how AIType compares favorably to Grammarly for iOS users:

Unlike the basic grammarly translate function, AIType provides seamless, context-aware translations that maintain the original tone and intent of your message, making it an indispensable tool for multilingual communication.
