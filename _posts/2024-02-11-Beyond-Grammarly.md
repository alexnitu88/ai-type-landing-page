Enter AIType, an innovative AI-assisted keyboard iOS app that's redefining the landscape of digital writing tools.

## The Evolution of Writing Assistance

Before we delve into the intricacies of AIType, let's take a moment to appreciate the journey of writing assistance technology. Tools similar to Grammarly have set the stage, offering grammar checks for free, and have been a boon for writers of all calibers. However, as the demand for smarter, more intuitive tools grows, the technology must evolve. AIType is the next step in this evolution.

## Why Choose AIType Over Grammarly?

While platforms like Grammarly provide basic writing support, AIType harnesses the power of ChatGPT and GPT-4 to elevate your writing experience.
